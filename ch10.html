<h2><em>chapter</em> TENTH</h2>
<p>The train settles, its spindly legs retracting, the vast, battered sheets of insect carapace finally at rest.</p>
<p>You take a breath. CERULEAN and Viv on either side. Outside, the mechanical parts of the train will be unfolding into an emergency stairway, since you can hardly expect a proper train platform. The last part of the journey was especially rough—uncomfortable stares, polite shakes of the head whenever you or CERULEAN offers to do anything in the vicinity of Theosebeia. You’ve been spending a lot of time with CROSSROADS in the vesicle, though she’s been concentrating hard to bring the train’s long-inactive tunneling capabilities online.</p>
<p>The last couple of days were a cacophony of juddering and shaking, as the train’s ancient jaws strained to purge the rock between you and the free settlement. Granny Nauts had been rubbing her hands together with delight, telling everyone in earshot that she hadn’t seen a train cut a new tunnel for most of a lifetime. It was interesting, the first few times.</p>
<p>Now, you wait for the doors to open and welcome you to… to… well, supposedly, to home.</p>
<p>A clunk. “All right, uh, whenever you’re ready.” Even CROSSROADS sounds hesitant. CERULEAN steps forward, and turns the wheel on the escape hatch. You feel Viv flinch from the shrieking metal. Hopefully it won’t break.</p>
<p>You expected darkness outside: a slightly larger cave, perhaps lit by some sort of bioluminescent fungus. Instead, you meet painfully bright sunlight. A searing white wall at the top of a steep valley, everything else cast into broken silhouettes.</p>
<p>Your VECTOR eyes snap to as the others raise hands to block out the sun. It’s startlingly green. Even in State parks, you’ve never seen such vegetation. Plants coat the sides of the valley, clawing past each other to reach the sliver of light in a dense mat. Here and there, you can see large metal shells painted a variety of colours, and human-made bridges stretching to and fro. Darting figures that might be monkeys, or might be VECTORs.</p>
<p>The train is surrounded by water: an underground river which laps at the carapace, carrying away a colourful sheen of oil. A motley contingent waits at the bottom of the emergency chute: tall enough that they must be VECTORs, but far more varied than any VECTORs you’ve ever seen.</p>
<p>You must have gone south. The rainy side of the mountains, where the clouds dump their water on the long climb, especially in the summer. You vaguely recall watching a documentary about State explorers in the rainforest, searching for lost settlements from before the Harsh Century.</p>
<p>Apparently they missed this one.</p>
<hr>
<p>CERULEAN watches the new VECTORs warily. All sorts of unwelcome memories from her training come back, describing the flaws in these ‘degenerate specimens’ that a loyal State vector could properly exploit. A term which certain members of AVIATRIX clade picked up gleefully to throw at the less popular trainees, while CERULEAN had just turned aside, quietly glad it wasn’t her.</p>
<p>What had happened to those girls? ‘Transferred out’ was all she’d ever heard.</p>
<p>The specimens in question, at least, are not privy to such thoughts, regarding the new arrivals mostly with equal wariness. Not all of them have been VECTORised, but the ones who have not stand among the VECTORs with an ease CERULEAN has never seen from civilians. She’s surprised by the variety: these people must have come from the breadth of the State. Their clothes are equally varied. Some wear the striking uniforms she’s used to in rebel VECTORs, patched together from State materials, replete with studs and decoration. Others wear what must be locally produced fibres, roughly cut and sewn.</p>
<p>But most of all, she’s struck by the variety in their bodies. Not just buff VECTORs, fat VECTORS, and skinny VECTORs, but VECTORs with antlers, VECTORs with bioluminescent patches, a VECTOR with large compound eyes like an insect. Compared to the military…</p>
<p>She feels CHIASMUS startle slightly and reaches for her hand, as much for herself as anything. Together, they follow Viv down the ramp. It is uncomfortably quiet. A few of the onlookers whisper to each other.</p>
<p>As she reaches the bottom, the big, antlered VECTOR steps deftly around Viv to suddenly clap her on the shoulder, grinning extremely widely. “Welcome, welcome!” she says, her voice booming in the stillness. She looks CERULEAN up and down, taking in her tattered uniform, patched with poorly-fitting gifts from the train crew. “Damn, you’ve really been through it. Come on, someone get these comrades some food!”</p>
<p>The spell broken, CERULEAN finds herself surrounded by unfamiliar faces. They’re much more reticent about touching than most VECTORs she’s known, and full of questions: what’s going on in the State? Where’s CORAL? Did she really create a weapon to use on the Pillar Girls?</p>
<p>Antlers shoes them away, and smiles ruefully. “We don’t get a lot of visitors.” she says. “But I imagine <em>you</em> want to go to OPHANIM as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>CHIASMUS suddenly focuses. “Perhaps you could clarify…” She grimaces. “Who or what exactly is OPHANIM? Some kind of council?”</p>
<p>The antlered VECTOR only smiles wider. “I suppose you <em>could</em> say that!”</p>
<hr>
<p>“We need two things to proceed: a target, and a vulnerability.” The room is dark; the Director stands somewhere in the shadows, the light just catching the sharp lines of her face. Other functionaries, Investigators and officers sit, listening attently to NEMATODE’s words.</p>
<p>“Our operation with CORAL is coming close to bearing fruit. When it does, we must act quickly. Our actions will quite possibly determine the future of our State.” In more ways than the obvious. “We need a decisive weapon, to answer the insurgents’ attacks on our infrastructure with overwhelming force. Thanks to your diligent work in this facility, we have found one.”</p>
<p>NEMATODE motions for the handlers to bring the VECTOR specimen into the room. POLYTOPE is not bound, but she still stares at the floor, occasionally flicking a glance about the room. NEMATODE spots a few small, sadistic smiles as the officers prepare for the show. Does that one think she can’t see his hand going down his pants?</p>
<p>POLYTOPE’s terror is no act—there are a great many ways this could go wrong. But NEMATODE promised she’ll have the last laugh.</p>
<p>“The device has a variety of delivery methods, but for this demonstration, a pistol will suffice.” NEMATODE opens the dull metal box on the table, and picks up a stubby little gun, like an Arbitrator might use. There are two catridges in the case: one normal, and one locked in another, smaller, box, marked on all sides with radiation hazard symbols.</p>
<p>“POLYTOPE, would you care to demonstrate that your VECTOR abilities are at full capacity?” POLYTOPE swallows, and NEMATODE disapassionately raises the pistol and shoots her in the head. A second later, the wound heals, and she spits out the bullet, its tiny legs wriggling. “As you all know, Arbitrator weapons—though devastating on un-Engineered individuals—are unable to overcome a VECTOR’s self-repair processes. This is both the great advantage of my clade, and the reason we present such a problem.”</p>
<p>A few eyes narrow at that ‘we’. Let them.</p>
<p>“Now.” NEMATODE opens the smaller box, and takes out the second bullet. She feels the tingle of radiation on her skin, sees the haze of it with her VECTOR sight. She chambers it in the pistol.</p>
<p>POLYTOPE’s eyes widen slightly.</p>
<p>NEMATODE takes aim at the centre of her face, and fires again.</p>
<p>The change is not instant. Tears open in POLYTOPE’s face, filled with a mat of white strands, disintegrating and reforming. Her nose falls off and dissolves to nothing. The layers of muscle reweave themselves, and in the gaps, NEMATODE can see bones reshaping.</p>
<p>Some of the officials look away. Others lean in, eagerly.</p>
<p>The transformation finishes. Where POLYTOPE stood is, to all appearances, a perfect clone of NEMATODE.</p>
<p>“The VECTOR body answers directly to a will—usually, that of the host. But together, we have discovered that this will can be overridden. I have seized control, and POLYTOPE will now do absolutely anything I command.”</p>
<p>The Director steps out of the shadows, heels clicking on the floor. “I wish to test this claim, TWELVE DOCTRIX NEMATODE.”</p>
<p>NEMATODE nods. “Please, sir.”</p>
<p>“SIX AVIATRIX POLYTOPE. Break your arm, and keep it broken.”</p>
<p>Sorry, POLYTOPE. But she knew what she signed up for. NEMATODE watches POLYTOPE grab her own arm and sharply snap it. A shard of bone cuts skin and uniform. It does not heal.</p>
<p>Somewhere in POLYTOPE, there is a clone of NEMATODE’s mind, doing this to her. Or perhaps she’s willing to do it herself. NEMATODE has no idea what it’s like to receive the treatment.</p>
<p>The Director nods approvingly. “Remarkable. I wonder what else we can get her to do…”</p>
<hr>
<p>Reaching OPHANIM’s chamber takes a few VECTOR leaps. CERULEAN glances back now and again, but CHIASMUS seems to have got the hang of her VECTOR engine.</p>
<p>CERULEAN can feel the excitement of the pillar girls. Now she’s become aware of them, she’s started to recognise where her thoughts and feelings end, and theirs begin. For her own part, she feels a little sick. The last time she was surrounded by this many VECTORs was at the training barracks, before her first deployment to hunt down CORAL. She doesn’t know the lines of power yet, or her place.</p>
<p>CORAL had never told her much about OPHANIM, beyond the promise to meet them. Some sort of council of senior rebel VECTORs, coordinating operations against the State? ‘More or less.’ was CORAL’s reply… ‘but not exactly.’</p>
<p>They reach a large, hemispherical metal pod, clinging like a pustule to the steeply-sloping wall of the valley. The antlered VECTOR alights on a small, rusted balcony, reinforced by a messy agglomeration of wood and rope. She nods to a couple of VECTORs seem to have been assigned guard duty, who rather hurriedly disentangle themselves and attempt to look as on-duty as possible when half their clothes are on the floor nearby. CERULEAN flashes them a quick smile—she knows this situation too well.</p>
<p>The door was clearly once articulated, but now it’s been replaced with some sort of chitinous panel not unlike the shell of a train. Antlers gestures for her to enter. The inside is dim, and CERULEAN finds herself ducking under thick sheafs of cables and tubes. What light there is comes from a large glass shell in the centre of the room. Inside it…</p>
<p>It takes her a second to work out what she’s seeing.</p>
<p>Floating in the tank, in a fluid very similar to what she saw in the vesicle, is an agglomeration of VECTORs. CERULEAN can see at least five, no, six, their flesh and muscles interwoven in rather biomechanically dubious ways, mostly meeting at the hips. Four pairs of eyes fix on her—one breaks into a smile, then another. One of them gives a little wave.</p>
<p>She feels her mouth open, a question forming… No. She forces herself to close it and stand like this is perfectly normal. No doubt OPHANIM will be judging her by her reaction.</p>
<p>CHIASMUS has no such consumptions. “Oh.” she says. “OK, what the fuck?”</p>
<p>Thankfully, OPHANIM takes no offence—at least one of her seems to find it hilarious. A distorted voice emerges from a bank of speakers below the tank.</p>
<p>“I know, I know… takes some getting used to. You must be… CERULEAN and CHIASMUS?”</p>
<p>CERULEAN nods. She almost does a State salute, but suppresses the urge, resulting in a kind of half-salute, half-scratch her eyebrow. “The famed OPHANIM, I presume.”</p>
<p>“Just so!” OPHANIM revolves slowly, bringing different parts to face her visitors. Her voice changes as the different sections speak, one after the other. “Welcome, both of you. You’ve had a real <em>fucker</em> of a journey, from the sounds of things.”</p>
<p>Briefly, the image of NEMATODE saying this sentence passes through CERULEAN’s mind. It’s inexplicably hilarious.</p>
<p>“So.” OPHANIM continues. “Let’s get the formalities out of the way. Yes, we are seven different VECTORs stuck together and floating in a tank. We can talk about it later. These buildings… the State built them, a long, long time ago, before it really was the State. Somehow this valley survived all those disasters, and we moved in! Questions?”</p>
<p>CHIASMUS nods slowly, her brow furrowing. “Yes.” she says. “About four thousand!”</p>
<p>“Fantastic!” says OPHANIM. “But right now, I am going to answer none of them.” CHIASMUS splutters. One of the OPHANIM bodies raises a placating hand. “All in good time. Now, I have <em>got</em> to few things very clear: I’m <em>not</em> in charge, you do <em>not</em> have to obey my orders, and if you want to leave, you can do so whenever you please. I realise that doesn’t mean a lot given how few places like this there are, but, that’s the world we’re living in\~!”</p>
<p>The antlered VECTOR sighs gently. “In practice we find we’re better off if we listen to them. OPHANIM’s been at this longer than any of us. Hence the, well…”</p>
<p>“I said, we’d talk about that later, CARIBOU!” OPHANIM gives a petulant little twirl, a whirl of arms trailing the motion like some sort of jellyfish.</p>
<p>CERULEAN frowns. There’s defintely something off here. “What’s the great hurry?”</p>
<p>“Right! Business then. The situation we find ourself in is not… ideal.”</p>
<hr>
<p>The nomads’ camp is as bright and rich as the steppe was grey and empty. After so long alone, CORAL can hardly take it in. She flinches at each movement and raised voice, almost snarls when she catches a question.</p>
<p>Mote, for their own part, seems oblivious to her anxiety. They lead their Strider in between the ribbed tents, large bugs of burden and smaller flocks of skittish striders. Every now and then, they see someone who gives them a nod or offers a drink at a fire, all speaking an unfamiliar language. CORAL counts that there must be dozens of herders, but the people are vastly outnumbered by their animals. To think, they were so near!</p>
<p>“It is an inauspicious place we found you, the village of the dead.” Mote says mildly, at one point. “A place we leave undisturbed, for respect.”</p>
<p>CORAL flicks her eyes over, trying to measure if there’s any offence there. But Mote is still smiling their good-humoured smile, already distracted by another family of herders. Finally, they reach a tent that is not surrounded by animals. Mote smiles to two bearded men deep in conversation at the entrance, and ties their strider to a post.</p>
<p>“My husbands.” they say simply. Then, they lift aside the flap for CORAL nad the three not-VECTOR girls to enter the tent. CORAL ducks inside, stepping into a wall of heat from the roaring fire at the centre. She steps aside, feet landing on a soft, striderskin floor.</p>
<p>Mote steps in behind. “I have sent word to the other families.” They gesture for CORAL to sit down on some of the scattered cushions. “They will be along shortly. My husbands and I shall have to prepare a hearty meal… tell me, what do you think of boiled beetles?”</p>
<p>“Sounds fantastic.” CORAL is too hungry to think of something witty to say. “Honestly? At this point I’d eat my own arm.” Alas, VECTOR autocannibalism, while not fatal, tends to exacerbate, not relieve, the problems of hunger.</p>
<p>“Then I shall be back in but a moment!” Mote pours a drink of something into a series of beetle-shell cups, and passes them to each of the guests. “Please, rest. It will not be long.”</p>
