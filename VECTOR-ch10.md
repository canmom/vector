## *chapter* TENTH

The train settles, its spindly legs retracting, the vast, battered sheets of insect carapace finally at rest.

You take a breath. CERULEAN and Viv on either side. Outside, the mechanical parts of the train will be unfolding into an emergency stairway, since you can hardly expect a proper train platform. The last part of the journey was especially rough---uncomfortable stares, polite shakes of the head whenever you or CERULEAN offers to do anything in the vicinity of Theosebeia. You've been spending a lot of time with CROSSROADS in the vesicle, though she's been concentrating hard to bring the train's long-inactive tunneling capabilities online.

The last couple of days were a cacophony of juddering and shaking, as the train's ancient jaws strained to purge the rock between you and the free settlement. Granny Nauts had been rubbing her hands together with delight, telling everyone in earshot that she hadn't seen a train cut a new tunnel for most of a lifetime. It was interesting, the first few times.

Now, you wait for the doors to open and welcome you to... to... well, supposedly, to home.

A clunk. "All right, uh, whenever you're ready." Even CROSSROADS sounds hesitant. CERULEAN steps forward, and turns the wheel on the escape hatch. You feel Viv flinch from the shrieking metal. Hopefully it won't break.

You expected darkness outside: a slightly larger cave, perhaps lit by some sort of bioluminescent fungus. Instead, you meet painfully bright sunlight. A searing white wall at the top of a steep valley, everything else cast into broken silhouettes.

Your VECTOR eyes snap to as the others raise hands to block out the sun. It's startlingly green. Even in State parks, you've never seen such vegetation. Plants coat the sides of the valley, clawing past each other to reach the sliver of light in a dense mat. Here and there, you can see large metal shells painted a variety of colours, and human-made bridges stretching to and fro. Darting figures that might be monkeys, or might be VECTORs.

The train is surrounded by water: an underground river which laps at the carapace, carrying away a colourful sheen of oil. A motley contingent waits at the bottom of the emergency chute: tall enough that they must be VECTORs, but far more varied than any VECTORs you've ever seen.

You must have gone south. The rainy side of the mountains, where the clouds dump their water on the long climb, especially in the summer. You vaguely recall watching a documentary about State explorers in the rainforest, searching for lost settlements from before the Harsh Century.

Apparently they missed this one.

CERULEAN watches the new VECTORs warily. All sorts of unwelcome memories from her training come back, describing the flaws in these 'degenerate specimens' that a loyal State vector could properly exploit. A term which certain members of AVIATRIX clade picked up gleefully to throw at the less popular trainees, while CERULEAN had just turned aside, quietly glad it wasn't her.

What had happened to those girls? 'Transferred out' was all she'd ever heard.

The specimens in question, at least, are not privy to such thoughts, regarding the new arrivals mostly with equal wariness. Not all of them have been VECTORised, but the ones who have not stand among the VECTORs with an ease CERULEAN has never seen from civilians. She's surprised by the variety: these people must have come from the breadth of the State. Their clothes are equally varied. Some wear the striking uniforms she's used to in rebel VECTORs, patched together from State materials, replete with studs and decoration. Others wear what must be locally produced fibres, roughly cut and sewn.

But most of all, she's struck by the variety in their bodies. Not just buff VECTORs, fat VECTORS, and skinny VECTORs, but VECTORs with antlers, VECTORs with bioluminescent patches, a VECTOR with large compound eyes like an insect. Compared to the military...

She feels CHIASMUS startle slightly and reaches for her hand, as much for herself as anything. Together, they follow Viv down the ramp. It is uncomfortably quiet. A few of the onlookers whisper to each other.

As she reaches the bottom, the big, antlered VECTOR steps deftly around Viv to suddenly clap her on the shoulder, grinning extremely widely. "Welcome, welcome!" she says, her voice booming in the stillness. She looks CERULEAN up and down, taking in her tattered uniform, patched with poorly-fitting gifts from the train crew. "Damn, you've really been through it. Come on, someone get these comrades some food!"

The spell broken, CERULEAN finds herself surrounded by unfamiliar faces. They're much more reticent about touching than most VECTORs she's known, and full of questions: what's going on in the State? Where's CORAL? Did she really create a weapon to use on the Pillar Girls?

Antlers shoes them away, and smiles ruefully. "We don't get a lot of visitors." she says. "But I imagine *you* want to go to OPHANIM as soon as possible."

CHIASMUS suddenly focuses. "Perhaps you could clarify..." She grimaces. "Who or what exactly is OPHANIM? Some kind of council?"

The antlered VECTOR only smiles wider. She cackles...

"I suppose you *could* say that!"

"We need two things to proceed: a target, and a vulnerability." The room is dark; the Director stands somewhere in the shadows, the light just catching the sharp lines of her face. Other functionaries, Investigators and officers sit, listening attently to NEMATODE's words.

"Our operation with CORAL is coming close to bearing fruit. When it does, we must act quickly. Our actions will quite possibly determine the future of our State." In more ways than the obvious. "We need a decisive weapon, to answer the insurgents' attacks on our infrastructure with overwhelming force. Thanks to your diligent work in this facility, we have found one."

NEMATODE motions for the handlers to bring the specimen into the room. POLYTOPE is not bound, but she still stares at the floor, occasionally flicking a glance about the room. NEMATODE spots a few small, sadistic smiles as the officers prepare for the show. Does that one think she can't see his hand going down his pants?

POLYTOPE's terror is no act---there are a great many ways this could go wrong. But NEMATODE promised she'll have the last laugh.

"The device has a variety of delivery methods, but for this demonstration, a pistol will suffice." NEMATODE opens the dull metal box on the table, and picks up a stubby little gun, like an Arbitrator might use. There are two catridges in the case: one normal, and one locked in another, smaller, box, marked on all sides with radiation hazard symbols.

"POLYTOPE, would you care to demonstrate that your VECTOR abilities are at full capacity?" POLYTOPE swallows, and NEMATODE disapassionately raises the pistol and shoots her in the head. A second later, the wound heals, and she spits out the bullet, its tiny legs wriggling. "As you all know, Arbitrator weapons---though devastating on un-Engineered individuals---are unable to overcome a VECTOR's self-repair processes. This is both the great advantage of my clade, and the reason we present such a problem."

A few eyes narrow at that 'we'. Let them.

"Now." NEMATODE opens the smaller box, and takes out the second bullet. She feels the tingle of radiation on her skin, sees the haze of it with her VECTOR sight. She chambers it in the pistol.

POLYTOPE's eyes widen slightly.

NEMATODE takes aim at the centre of her face, and fires again.

The change is not instant. Tears open in POLYTOPE's face, filled with a mat of white strands, disintegrating and reforming. Her nose falls off and dissolves to nothing. The layers of muscle reweave themselves, and in the gaps, NEMATODE can see bones reshaping.

Some of the officials look away. Others lean in, eagerly.

The transformation finishes. Where POLYTOPE stood is a perfect clone of NEMATODE.

"The VECTOR body answers directly to a will---usually, that of the host. But together, we have discovered that this will can be overridden. I have seized control, and POLYTOPE will now do absolutely anything I command."

The Director steps out of the shadows, heels clicking on the floor. "I wish to test this claim, TWELVE DOCTRIX NEMATODE."

NEMATODE nods. "Please."
