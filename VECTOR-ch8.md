## *chapter* EIGHTH

CORAL is walking.

Her memories of the facility have become a jumbled blur, snatches of pain and images of burned flesh which appear when she closes her eyes. Where _was_ she taken? If she knew the landmarks, knew how to follow the stars, she might lead her comrades back to this prison, storm the place, free whoever else is trapped there.

But she's never been here. This land is as anonymous as the torturers.

She's been walking for a week. Now she can see the passage of night and day, she's been keeping count obsessively, scratching the tally into her arm again and again as her body erases the marks. All she's seen in that time is scrubby grass and gorse cut by freezing streams, distant mountains that never seem to get any closer.

Since she joined OPHANIM, she's fought in many places---but all of them, on some level, the same. Pillar girls, pustule-like houses atop radiation-hardened burrows, scavengers scurrying at night. Some of them hot and dry, some cold and wet, but all of them stamped with the State's marks.

They must have taken her to the very edge of the State's territory, perhaps even outside of it. Why? Torturing rebels could hardly be a secret. She chews on this question, but comes no closer to an answer.

Now and then, a State aircraft comes overhead, swooping over the steppe in low circles. CORAL considers using her stolen VECTOR engine to go on the attack, springing up into the sky to seize control of the aircraft, but she still feels utterly depleted. No doubt they have VECTORs on board, anyway. So whenever the aircraft comes too close, she hides in one of the streams, feeling it slowly warm from the radiation leaking out of her body. And so far, well... they haven't found her.

After nine days, she reaches the village.

NEMATODE salutes stiffly. The Director is not looking at her, which somehow manages to be even more disconcerting than having those hexagon pupils fix in her direction. Anticipation, perhaps.

"Sir. You wished to see me?" She can't help but let a note of disapproval slip into her voice. CORAL has been making reasonable progress across the steppe, NEMATODE's secret making up for any deficiencies in their tracking materiel. The missing train is more of a concern. But that was all covered in her report. Why call her personally to the Director's office, at such an hour?

The Director remains silent for slightly longer than is comfortable.

NEMATODE waits.

She does not fidget. It would be beneath her.

"Tell me." the Director says, eventually. "This 'runaway train'. What do you suppose happened?"

"Sir." NEMATODE swallows. What is the purpose of this question? "I've reported the available theories from our consultant engineers. They give the greatest odds that the terrorists have some novel technological means to intercept control signals---effective on both the Infrastructurals and the train system."

The Director's lip curls. "How predictably unimaginative. But I did not ask what the *consultant engineers* think. What is *your* opinion, NEMATODE?"

"You mean, as CERULEAN's instructor, sir?" This _must_ be leading somewhere, but the Director seems determined to lead NEMATODE through this game.

"I mean, as what you *are*." *Now* the Director's eyes fix on NEMATODE. Her pupils seem to twist, like the aperture of a camera. "How would a VECTOR try to take control of a train?"

"Well." As if all VECTORs think, feel and act the same. If *that* were the case, there wouldn't even be a war. "The most obvious route would be to compromise the train pilot. Convince her of their misguided project."

The Director nods. "And your inquiries into this pilot have shown?"

"She wouldn't take much convincing. A number of infractions on record, despite multiple rounds of Rehabilitation." This was all in the report, but the Director seems to want to hear her say it. "In fact, an Arbitrator unit was moving to apprehend a seditionist cell we had discovered on board the train, just prior to the incident. I doubt they could have remained undetected for long, without the pilot's at least tacit support."

"And yet. This theory has been ruled out. Why?"

"The pilot had a restraint device implanted into her spinal column. With it attached, she could not break from the official route. Removing it would have killed her."

"Indeed." The director smiles. It does not reach her eyes. "So, NEMATODE. Why do you think VECTORs have not been fitted with such a device? It would save us all a lot of trouble, don't you think?"

One day ago, it was a dark smudge on the horizon. Now, as CORAL stalks the silent street, it finally resolves itself. The buildings are hardly the standard design: none of the bony trees produced by the pillar girls, none of the egg-like pods that typically fill a residential area.

No, the buildings here appear to have begun life as the shells of large bugs. Something very close to a train, if the segments never suffered the end-to-end grafting process. Each house boasts striking antlers of glossy keratin, though the effect is rather diminished by the dirt and plant life coating every surface.

The street is just as overgrown. Organic muck sucks at CORAL's bare feet---the original paving more of a gesture. Here and there, a small patch of taller grass.

An impulse strikes her. She steps up to one of these taller patches, digs in the muck with a foot. Sure enough, her toe finds something hard: an eye socket, the hint of teeth.

Someone's skull.

Carefully, she brushes the muck back on top of the unmarked grave. Whoever killed these people must not have bothered to move them, and they rotted where they lay. Usually, a scavenger would quickly come to crack these bones for marrow, but the rules must be different here.

She ducks into one of the buildings---no reason to pick one over the other. The entrance has been roughly sawn through the bug's carapace. If it once held a door, it must have rotted away.

Inside, the stench of mould is much stronger. Dark moss covers every surface, in every colour of a very subdued rainbow. In the centre of the room, a small mound appears to have been a cooking pot, now just flakes of rust which dissolve before she can even touch them.

What did she hope to find? A map? A sign saying 'this way back to OPHANIM's hidden base'?

After a desultory search, she emerges back into the fading daylight. The air is only slightly fresher, but it's a relief all the same. If she wasn't a VECTOR, she'd have a lot of respiratory diseases to think about right now.

Something trills on a nearby street. Even now, her reflexes are good. A BLADE in hand in the space of a breath. CORAL flips herself upwards, and then flattens herself against the back of one of the bug-houses. There...

A scavenger? It looks humanoid, perhaps not too far down the path of transformation. Most of the State's engineering failures are euthanised and recycled, but occasionally some escape, and multiply in the abandoned parts of the city. When there's no insurrections to suppress, the Strider cavalry are pest controllers. Whatever it is, it drags itself slowly through the muck, letting out the same faint trill.

CORAL's stomach rumbles. VECTORs won't die from starvation, but hunger still impresses an overwhelming need which inhibits most of her other functions. This scavenger is the first living creature she's seen since her escape. She doesn't like to eat the scavengers, but in a situation like this?

She drops back down to the street. Even jumping onto that roof has left her exhausted. If NEMATODE caught her now, it would be an even more embarassing repeat of the scene in the furnace.

Softly, mud sucking at her feet, she walks up behind the scavenger. Well, probably 'behind'. Everything about this creature goes in a different direction. Are those digitigrade legs, or simply backwards? It holds its arms up against its chest, like a mantis. As CORAL reaches striking distance, it abruptly tilts its head backwards to look her in the eye. Its face is drawn, emaciated.

"I'm sorry." CORAL says. As if it means anything to say so. She cuts the creature in two.

Her breath catches.

Where the upper half has fallen, white threads start to grow, slow but unmistakeable. It must be starving, must be as miserable as her---but she knows exactly what it is.

"You're a VECTOR!?"

---

"I'm not sure I know, sir. A technological limitation?" NEMATODE does not allow her face to express anything. Let the Director threaten her all she wants. Most of the pieces are in place, now.

The Director has not stopped smiling. Or leering, perhaps. "Not even a twitch. Oh, you are so _good_, NEMATODE!" Her behaviour is off. Has she taken some sort of drug? NEMATODE almost pities her.

"Sir." she says, unsure what else to remark. Perhaps her disgust has reached her face.

The Director does not notice, lost in her story. "You're right, in a way. Though it's less a limitation than a contradiction. To try to limit you like that would spoil what makes you *work*, you know?"

NEMATODE's body itches. She's spent so long keeping herself in this shape. "May I ask the purpose of this meeting, sir?"

The Director waves a hand, affably. "Of course. Always to the point! But that's how we made you. You're here to help me solve a point of *philosophy*."

NEMATODE wants to scream.

"What question is that?"

"Your VECTOR engine. Would you pass it to me?"

"If that is your order, sir." At this point, her sarcasm is getting dangerously obvious, but NEMATODE unstraps the weapon from her hip holster, and passes it over. The Director holds it curiously, hefts it in her hands, peers intently at the needle connection.

"Does this satisfy your philosophical inquiry, sir?" she ventures. Let the Director play with the toy. It won't do *her* any good.

The Director looks back up at her. Her eyes seem to refocus. "Tell me, NEMATODE. Why do you think you're called VECTORs, anyway?"

NEMATODE frowns. One rhetorical question was already more than enough. "Because the VECTOR engine allows motion along arbitrary vectors?" she ventures.

The Director sighs.

"Another engineer's answer. Think more fundamentally!"

"Sir. I'm not sure what you're driving at, and I have duties to attend to." This is a lie, of course: NEMATODE keeps well ahead on her responsibilities as a commander. But the radiation experiments are so close to fruition. She's sure of it.

The Director nods slowly, and passes her the VECTOR engine. "Very well, NEMATODE. Perhaps when your _duties_ are less pressing, we can talk again."

---

CORAL has taken her erstwhile meal's legs and shoved them back up against its body. Too late, she realises she's turned its legs around. The white threads grip onto the not-yet-dead VECTOR flesh, recognise it as *self*, and the starving VECTOR's legs start to kick, sending clods of muck into the air.

She lets out her held breath. For a long moment, everything is still. The shadows creep slightly longer.

Abruptly, there is a harsh crack. The VECTOR's legs rotate a full 180 degrees, settling back into their original, oddly backwards orientation. The skin does not tear, but bulges strangely as muscles remake themselves underneath.

CORAL reaches out her hand, to help it---no, _her_!---to her feet. The VECTOR blinks at her, unmoving.

"What happened to you?" CORAL says, settling on the muck. It would be impolite to mention that she had been planning to murder this woman and eat her. The VECTOR trills, and then something shifts in her throat, and she coughs abruptly.

"Scrambled. Rad---radiation." Her voice is a wet whisper, stumbling over the consonants. It seems like it takes a great deal of effort to maintain a functional voicebox. "Who're?" she manages, and sits up, staring CORAL right in the eye.

That's more like it.

"You've been irradiated?" Does that happen? Her mind leaps to Rugosa, reduced to an oily pillar at the centre of the Furnace, dissolved by her own body's radiation. "How? What happened?" Perhaps that's why they're so far from the State proper---so the immortal errors of their experiments don't wander anywhere they might cause a fuss.

Her companion doesn't seem to be able to answer. She struggles to her feet, slipping once. CORAL stands up and offers her a shoulder.

"Come with me. It's safe." The girl's voice emerges again, still a little slurred.

Why would she trust someone who would _cut her in half_ by way of greeting? How long since she last saw a person? CORAL follows, burning with curiosity, more alive than she has felt in a long while.

NEMATODE is back in the Director's office, all too soon.

"It's a matter of desire, you see." The Director is standing uncomfortably close. She points to NEMATODE's neck. "We could plant a device---right here!---and force you to act _exactly_ as we commanded. Just like a machine. But your body would grow around and over it---just as soon as you wanted something and the device intervened. That's the nature of your power. Desire is both fuel and the direction."

She's stepped out of NEMATODE's field of vision. NEMATODE suppresses the urge to grow an extra eye to watch her. That really wouldn't help.

"It used to be called alchemy, you know." The Director's voice is quiet in NEMATODE's ear. "Our art. We formalised it, regularised it, grew clade after clade to suit our purposes. We built our Great Work in the form of the gloriously perfected State."

"Why are you telling me this, sir?" If this is even true, it's ancient history---and history the Director was certainly not alive for, whatever her pretensions.




"Sir." . "If you want the attention of a pleasure clade, I will have a  sent up. But this is not within my duties."
