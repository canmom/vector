## *chapter* FIFTH

The train rushes along its overhead wires in a squirming wave of tiny, white legs. It resembles nothing so much as a long millipede, with a bulbous passenger car implanted into each segment of its long, round body. All around, ligaments and hemolymph vessels mix indistinguishably with hydraulic pipes and electric wires. As it runs, hair-like cilia ripple in the gaps between the shell plates, pigments shifting through a series of adverts and propaganda. Each image is slightly blotchy, the artists apparently unwilling to pick symbols more appropriate to the medium.

Something about its undulating motion reminds CERULEAN of NEMATODE's transformation. She leans on Chiasmus, who glances over with concern.

CERULEAN takes a steadying breath. It's not right. She's supposed to be the strong one, the bold, experienced VECTOR. But the fierce urgency that carried her through the fight against NEMATODE has abandoned her, and now CHIASMUS is having to work out a plan for escape. Thus: the train.

Buying tickets is, of course, out of the question. Even if they had internal passports, their VECTOR bodies are impossible to hide. But they have to board the train.

The day prior, CHIASMUS had managed to restore electricity to their hideout, and activate a dilapidated TV. CERULEAN was greeted by her own face, as NEMATODE explained to a crowd of reporters that the rebel VECTORs carried out a vicious and unprecedented terrorist attack, targeting the innocent pillar girls in an act of supreme blasphemy---but through the bravery of the State VECTOR Dragoons and Strider cavalry, their attack has been repelled and their leader captured. And of course, VECTOR reinforcements would soon be arriving to ferret out any surviving rebels, wherever they may be hiding.

From what she gleaned of CORAL's plan, they should count this a great success. The reinforcements would be pulled from the front lines, relieving pressure on the rebels elsewhere---and now they have proof of an incredible new ally in the literal foundations of the state. But it does not feel like a victory. CERULEAN has only the vaguest ideas of what happens to captured rebel VECTORs, but her imagination certainly didn't hesitate to fill in the gaps.

But there's nothing she can do. Nothing. However good she is---and she *knows* she's good, even now---CERULEAN can't stand up against a full clade of VECTORs. No choice but to escape, regroup, link up with other fugitives, and form a plan that stands a real chance of rescuing CORAL.

And right now, boarding a moving train without being noticed seems *considerably* easier.

Not that it's hard to board a moving train. But VECTORs are not subtle creatures, by their artificial nature. If nothing else, the train itself is sure to notice...

---

You look away from CERULEAN. Whatever she's thinking about, you don't feel much up to helping. And you're a little tired of always being the one to reassure her, at this point.

In the distance, the train reaches an entrance to the tunnels, and an iris opens to admit it. Your train will be along shortly. The VECTOR engine in your hand---*your* VECTOR engine!---thrums in readiness. The needle in your palm doesn't hurt, but still hovers insistently at the edge of your attention. You've been practicing over the last couple of days, and you're pretty certain you can make this jump, but, well. You're not getting a second chance.

The front of a train is a bulbous white sac, protected not by the exoskeleton but by a metal mesh roughly stapled to the end of the exoskeleton. Presumably it has some sensory purpose. The stable would occasionally set aside a wing for refurbishing a train, but you were never trusted to see one up close. You've seen their nest on the TV, an enthusiastic Endustrial leading the presenter past a clutch of train grubs and explaining with some glee how the splicing machine can be used to create a train of almost arbitrary length. Remove head, remove tail, connect the tubes... feed the waste to the next generation to save on feeding costs.

The white sac wasn't mentioned. You never wondered, until now...

"Ready?" CERULEAN asks. You've been ready for the past half hour, but you don't bother saying so, merely nod and watch for the train to pass the last pylon.

Is that a humanoid figure you can see, deep in the white sac?

No time to think. CERULEAN tenses, and then the two of you are up in the air, the train filling your vision with terrifying speed. The LANCE forms almost without thinking, and you slam, hard, into the train's thick carapace desperately holding on, narrowly avoiding the blur of wires...

CERULEAN is already using her LANCE to spring up the side of the train and grab onto the passenger car. It's all you can do to maintain your grip... you have to let the engine do the work! Like you were taught! Will your body to move and let that desire flow through, dance with it...

A crack runs up the carapace beside you.

Before you know it, you're scrambling hand over foot over the rough surface, all dignity and elegance forgotten in favour of brute VECTOR strength. CERULEAN catches you, and pulls you in close to avoid decapitation on the wires.

You realise you're bleeding. Hands, shoulders... it's already healing, of course.

Beside CERULEAN, the emergency hatch emerges from the pitted metal like a pustule. CERULEAN grabs the handle, gives it a solid shove... the metal groans, clearly unfamiliar with oil. How a non-VECTOR was supposed to open this doesn't bear thinking about. Ponderously, it swings open...

There is a sharp crack from inside.

CERULEAN's hand disintegrates into bloody chunks. She looks more annoyed than hurt, waits just outside the door as her hand reknits itself. "Was that really necessary!?"

You wonder if her words could even be heard over the thrumming of the wires and the grinding of train's carapace, but after a moment a reply does come in the form of a high, wavering voice. "Fuck! All right, we surrender!" CERULEAN rolls her eyes, and flips neatly into the door. You manage to follow, after a few frozen seconds.

The origin of the voice turns out to be a short, round woman in a slightly grubby Industrial uniform. She's holding some kind of sawn-off shotgun, which has filled the escape corridor with a thin haze of foul-smelling smoke. Further behind her, you see the fearful eyes of a group of civilians, each holding an assortment of makeshift weaponry: kitchen knives, walking canes, and a very angry-looking ferret-like creature which seems to be causing a surprising amount of discomfort for CERULEAN.

The Industrial takes a deep breath, and you're suddenly very conscious of your inhuman height and fanficul, sexualised outfit. The kind of body you always wanted... but now, it feels like some kind of mean joke.

Nobody is laughing, though. But the fear in their eyes isn't much better.

"I will comply with any demands you make, but you should know that the train has automatically sent a distress signal and State forces are en route." the Industrial recites in a monotone. She sounds almost too exhausted to feel terror. "By policy, they will never negotiate with terrorists, even if you should take us hostage."

CERULEAN smiles, deactivating her VECTOR engine and holding it up to show it's disarmed. The civilians show no sign of relaxing.

"We're not here to hurt you." she says. "I know what they've been saying---but that's not how we operate. All we want is to ride on this train as far as the tunnels. We'll make our own way from there."

The Industrial scoffs. "Drop the act, please. You could kill me as easy as breathing, but I won't give you the satisfaction of pretending we're all friends here."

"As you will, then." CERULEAN leans against the wall, still smiling. You're a little less sure how to act, but you deactivate your Engine as well. After a little while, the group of civilians start to fidget, and a few of them retreat warily back towards the corner.

"Fucking stupid plan, if you don't mind me saying." You look up, startled. The Industrial snorts. "Do you even know where you're going down there? If they don't catch you, you'll be a feral train's breakfast."

CERULEAN doesn't rise to it, but you have to ask. "No way there's feral trains. They'd never let them survive."

The Industrial bursts out laughing. "*You're* the dreadful terrorists that's got them all worked up? No, dear, I was pulling your leg. But I mean it when I say you won't last a day."

"You have a better idea?"

"Now *that*---" she glances from side to side, affecting a mock hushed tone, "---would be aiding and abetting! Treason! Something dreadful like that, anyway. As an honest, law-abiding citizen..."

Then, almost too quietly to hear: "Take a hint, you silly girls..."

CERULEAN springs to her feet, summons a BLADE and levels it at the Industrial's neck. "How dare you!" she says in an *almost* convincing tone. "Take me to the command car - now." You follow them, trying not to give the game away. Glaring at the civilians with all the rage you can muster. It comes surprisingly easily.

Once you're out of sight, and apparently not in view of any cameras, the Industrial sighs theatrically. "Oh dear. I guess they don't teach acting in VECTOR school, huh."

"You don't need to help us."

"Well, I'm helping you, so tough! I'm sure the Vesties have bigger problems." She sounds less sure of that than simply resigned to her probable fate, but you decide not to press the point.

CERULEAN is still glancing up and down the corridor. "So what's your better idea, Industrial..?" she says, tension in her voice. You're now some distance from any windows, but the light suddenly dims... underground, then.

"FOUR VELVET, Viv to my friends. Here's what we're gonna do. They'll search this train up and down, but I know one place they won't check... if you don't mind getting a little damp."

CERULEAN eyes the way you came in, glances at you as if to say, stop humouring her. "That being?"

"Why, the pilot's bubble, where else? I'm sure she won't mind. She gets awfully lonely."

Of course, that weird white sac! Of course there'd be someone in it. You look quizzically at Viv. "They won't look in there?"

"Not without a very good reason. Look, it's a better shot than running around down here, is all I'm saying."

CERULEAN grabs your hand, pulls you towards the exit. "Look, we appreciate your help, VELVET, but we just can't trust you... we'll take our chances---"

"No." you say, surprising yourself. CERULEAN stares at you. Viv shrugs, and pointedly turns her back.

"Are you an idiot?" CERULEAN hisses. "She wants us locked in a tight space so she can hand us over to the inspectors in a nice little package. She'd go right up to a SIX, maybe even SEVEN---no more dead end train jobs, she'd have her own Furnace in a year or two! She'd be an idiot not to."

You feel your mouth twisting. "If that's what she wanted, she could tell the pilot to go down some dead-end tunnel and we'd be none the wiser. You think only VECTORs have a reason to fight back against the State?"

CERULEAN glares at you, offended. "Of course not! But we're not about to find an anarchistic cell on the first train we hijack. I trust our skills---I don't trust this woman!"

There is a crackle, and Viv twists a knob on her walkie talkie. A garbled voice sputters through - barely comprehensible, but you catch a few words. VECTORs, ten minutes. CERULEAN winces - no way you'll outrun them.

Viv raises an eyebrow. "Take us to the pilot." you say. She nods, and squeezes the button on the walkie talkie. "They've already left the train. Taking their chances in the tunnels." Then, she starts running.

By the time you reach the other end of the train, FOUR VELVET is noticeably out of breath. She leans on the wall, shakes her head. "Wish I could get what you girls are on." she mutters. Then, louder: "Right, I can't go any further. I know I'm asking you to take a lot on faith... and I promise you, I'll explain all this later. Get yourselves decontaminated, then climb on in."
